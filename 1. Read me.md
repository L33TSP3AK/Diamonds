>                           **Welcome!**
>                        Yes, you read that right.
>                  This preface is dedicated to you 
>                             —
>                 the unsung heroes of my journey.
> 
> While the world often celebrates the cheerleaders and supporters, I believe it's time to shine a spotlight on the **real MVPs: the critics, the haters, and the shit talking skid marks.**
> 
> 
> Without your delightful shade and relentless skepticism, my life would be as bland as a tofu sandwich at a barbecue. You see, every time you doubted my abilities, I felt a spark of motivation.
>
> 
> It’s like you were my personal cheerleading squad—if cheerleaders wore frowns and threw tomatoes instead of pom-poms.
> 
> Your comments have been the wind beneath my wings, propelling me to soar higher and proving that I can achieve greatness despite your best efforts to keep me grounded. 
> 
> Thank you for your unsolicited advice! 
> Your critiques have been like GPS directions in a world where I was just trying to wing it.
> 
> “Turn left at ‘You’ll Never Make It,’” you said. And guess what? I did! And I’m still going strong on this winding road of life. So here’s to you, my beloved haters!
> 
> May your keyboards always be sticky with the remnants of your passionate rants, and may your evenings be filled with endless scrolling through my success stories.
> 
> You’ve inspired me in ways I never thought possible—mostly by showing me exactly what not to do.
